#Etsy Open API v3

#<div class=\"wt-text-body-01\"><p class=\"wt-pt-xs-2 wt-pb-xs-2\">Etsy's Open API provides a simple RESTful interface for various Etsy.com features. The API endpoints are meant to replace Etsy's Open API v2, which is scheduled to end service in 2022.</p><p class=\"wt-pb-xs-2\">All of the endpoints are callable and the majority of the API endpoints are now in a beta phase. This means we do not expect to make any breaking changes before our general release. A handful of endpoints are currently interface stubs (labeled “Feedback Only”) and returns a \"501 Not Implemented\" response code when called.</p><p class=\"wt-pb-xs-2\">If you'd like to report an issue or provide feedback on the API design, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"wt-text-link wt-p-xs-0\" href=\"https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose\">please add an issue in Github</a>.</p></div>&copy; 2021-2022 Etsy, Inc.
